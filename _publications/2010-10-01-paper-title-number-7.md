excerpt: 'We generalize the study of the noisy Kuramoto model, considered on a network of two interacting communities, to the case where the interaction strengths within and across communities are taken to be different in general. Using a geometric interpretation of the self-consistency equations developed in Paper I of this series as well as perturbation arguments, we are able to identify all solution boundaries in the phase diagram. This allows us to completely classify the phase diagram in the four-dimensional parameter space and identify all possible bifurcation points. Furthermore, we analyze the asymptotic behavior of the solution boundaries. To illustrate these results and the rich behavior of the model, we present phase diagrams for selected regions of the parameter space.
The two-community noisy Kuramoto model is used to study the synchronization on two communities of oscillators, interacting within and across the communities. The two-community structure is relevant for neurophysiologists (e.g., to describe the body clock13) and social scientists (e.g., to analyze polarized opinion formation5,12,18). The stationary states (or critical points) of the system solve a system of equations that cannot be solved analytically. We analyze where phase transitions occur, i.e., where new stationary states occur when varying the parameters of the model.
