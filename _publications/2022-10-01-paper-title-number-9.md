excerpt: 'We develop a method based on computer algebra systems to represent the mutual pure strategy best-response dynamics of symmetric two-player, two-action repeated games played by players with a one-period memory. We apply this method to the iterated prisonerâ€™s dilemma, stag hunt, and hawk-dove games and identify all possible equilibrium strategy pairs and the conditions for their existence. The only equilibrium strategy pair that is possible in all three games is the win-stay, lose-shift strategy. Lastly, we show that the mutual best-response dynamics are realized by a sample batch Q-learning algorithm in the infinite batch size limit.
