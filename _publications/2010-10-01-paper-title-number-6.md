excerpt: 'We generalize the study of the noisy Kuramoto model, considered on a network of two interacting communities, to the case where the interaction strengths within and across communities are taken to be different in general. By developing a geometric interpretation of the self-consistency equations, we are able to separate the parameter space into ten regions in which we identify the maximum number of solutions in the steady state. Furthermore, we prove that in the steady state, only the angles 0 and Ï€ are possible between the average phases of the two communities and derive the solution boundary for the unsynchronized solution. Last, we identify the equivalence class relation in the parameter space corresponding to the symmetrically synchronized solution.
The Kuramoto model is a model for studying the synchronization of oscillators (e.g., fireflies flashing). We consider two groups of oscillators, synchronizing within and across groups. Studying the stationary-states (or critical points) of the system leads to a system of equations that cannot be solved analytically. We introduce a geometric interpretation of these equations that allows us to analyze when and how many solutions are possible given a vector of model parameters. It also allows us to identify when symmetric solutions (solutions where the two groups are equally synchronized) and unsynchronized solutions occur.
