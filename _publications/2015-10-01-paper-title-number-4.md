excerpt: 'We study the noisy Kuramoto model for two interacting communities of oscillators, where we allow the interaction in and between communities to be positive or negative (but not zero). We find that, in the thermodynamic limit where the size of the two communities tends to infinity, this model exhibits unstable non-symmetric synchronized solutions that bifurcate from the symmetric synchronized solution corresponding to the one-community noisy Kuramoto model, even in the case where the phase difference between the communities is zero and the interaction strengths are symmetric. The solutions are given by fixed points of a dynamical system. We find a critical condition for existence of a bifurcation line, as well as a pair of equations determining the bifurcation line as a function of the interaction strengths. Using the latter we are able to classify the types of solutions that are possible and thereby identify the phase diagram of the system. We also analyze properties of the bifurcation line in the phase diagram and its derivatives, calculate the asymptotics, and analyze the synchronization level on the bifurcation line. Part of the proofs are numerically assisted. Lastly, we present some simulations illustrating the stability of the various solutions as well as the possible transitions between these solutions.'
