During this poster presentation, I covered two recent papers on quantifying the liklihood with which multiagent reinforcement learning algorithms can learn to collude in two simple pricing environments. The first develops the theory and applies it to two-player, two-action games and can be downloaded [here](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4589989). The second applies the theory to a pricing environment with three prices and can be downloaded [here](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4594415).
